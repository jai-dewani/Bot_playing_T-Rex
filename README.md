# Bot_playing_T-Rex

### Working
I used *pyautogui* module of python to grab screenshots and crop a small part infront of T-Rex 
and check for any black pixels in that region. I press *space* using *pyautogui* module as well.  
The max score I have achived is only 400 because it still has problems keeping up with obtacles which are placed closly.  

*It ain't much but its honest work* 


Here are some example of how that box looks just before the bot detects a black region and decides to jump

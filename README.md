# Bot_playing_T-Rex

### Idea behind the project
I saw a video where one used a aurdino setup with a servo moter and light detecting sensor(I guess) which checkes for obstacles and signals to the motor to press the space key and I imagied this can be done via software too!  
So I used *pyautogui* module of python to grab screenshots and crop a small part infront of T-Rex 
and check for any black pixels in that region. I press *space* using *pyautogui* module as well. The max score I have achived is only 400 because it still has problems keeping up with obtacles which are placed closly.

Here are some example of how that box looks just before the bot detects a black region and decides to jump
